For Windows:

1.Download MongoDB:

Go to the MongoDB Download Center.
Select the appropriate version for Windows.

2.Install MongoDB:

Run the downloaded .msi installer.
Select "Complete" during installation.
Choose to install MongoDB as a service (recommended).
Make sure to include MongoDB Compass if you want a GUI for managing your databases.

3.Set the System Path:

Add the MongoDB bin folder to your system's PATH environment variable.
Navigate to the installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin) and copy the path.
Right-click on This PC > Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.
Under System variables, find Path, click Edit, and add MongoDB's bin directory.

4.Create Data and Log Directories:

MongoDB needs directories for data and logs.
Open a terminal (cmd or PowerShell) and create the following directories:

Copy code
mkdir C:\data\db
mkdir C:\data\log

5.Start MongoDB:

You can start MongoDB as a service (if you chose that during installation) or manually by running the following in the terminal:
bash

Copy code
mongod

The database will start running in the background.

6.Verify Installation:

Open a new terminal and type:

Copy code
mongo

This should launch the MongoDB shell, confirming the installation.
